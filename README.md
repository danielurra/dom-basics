## DOM automatic creation
The DOM is automatically created by your browser when an html file is open, it's based on the html and capable of ammend missing parts of the html code<br>
to create a validated html representation.
## From a blank HTML the DOM will add the Head and Body tags

Press `F12` immediately after opening this html file and select **Elements** you will see that even though we didn't add any html tag<br>
The the **Head** and **body** html tags were automatically added  by the DOM.<br>

If you are working on a `CSS` project, you must have some kind of knowledge related to the DOM model as it helps when we are using advanced selectors.<br>
