# DOM Basics
## What is the DOM
**DOM** stands for `Document Object Model`, it is a tree-like data structure that represents a web browserâ€™s model of a web page.<br>
It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.<br>
Conceptually, the DOM is a tree. A tree consists of **nodes**: every node has a parent (except for the root node), and zero or more child nodes.<br>

## DOM automatic creation
The DOM is automatically created by your browser when an html file is open, it's based on the html and capable of ammend missing parts of the html code<br>
to create a validated html representation.
## From a blank HTML the DOM will add the Head and Body tags
Let's create a blank html file that contains only one word "Hello" nothing else, see below:<br>
![blank-page-01](https://github.com/danielurra/dom-basics/assets/51704179/3788b460-1f8b-4fdc-bcf3-dfebafacc615)<br>
Press `F12` immediately after opening this html file with your preferred `web browser` (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) <br>
and select **Elements** you will see that even though we didn't add any html tag<br>
both the **Head** and **body** html tags are being shown on the DOM representation of your HTML file.<br>

## DOM and CSS
If you are working on a `CSS` project, you must have some kind of knowledge related to the DOM model as it helps when we are using advanced selectors.<br>
## Use JavaScript to query, manipulate, and create DOM elements.
You can use JavaScript (or other programming language) to manipulate pages, it requires understanding the DOM and the techniques available<br> 
to accomplish common tasks, such as:
* Selecting specific elements or
* Modifying the content of elements.<br>
## Inspect
One easy way to see the DOM representation of an html file is to use the `inspect` tool:<br>
